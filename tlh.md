### Noun inflection
The Klingon nouns have a number of suffixes arranged after each other for
lots of stuff.

Augmentation is used for more or less important, bigger, smaller etc.
€gt-norm: Nominal augmentation
Qagh Qagh+N+Sg+Nom error
Qagh’a’ Qagh+N+Aug+Sg+Nom huge mistake
QaghHom Qagh+N+Dim+Sg+Nom small mistake

Plural is marked by some suffixes
€gt-norm: nominal plurals
€ Qaghpu’ Qagh+N+Pl+Nom

Nouns are qualified by some other suffixes too
€gt-norm: nominal qualification
€ Qaghqoq Qagh+N+Sg+Foc/qoq+Nom error qoq

The possessor is marked in suffix too
€gt-norm: Nominal possession
€ QaghwIJ Qagh+N+Sg+PxSg1+Nom my error

cases add some semantic relations as usual
€gt-norm: Nominal cases
€ QaghDaq Qagh+N+Sg+Loc in an error
€ Qaghvo’ Qagh+N+Sg+Sep from an error


augmentation is optional

number marker is optional, singular being the unmarked form

qualification is optional

possession is optional

case marker is optional, nominative being the unmarked form


## Proper noun inflection
proper nouns inflect like nominals




# Symbol affixes





## Adjective inflection
No adjectives in Klingon



## Verb inflection
The Klingon language verbs inflect in persons with obligatory prefixes, then
the verb stem and all the optional suffixes..


*Verb prefixes examples:*
* *jIQong* `1Sg+Qong+V` (Eng. I sleep)
* *cholegh* `Sg2+Sg1O+legh+V` (Eng. you see me)

Reflexive suffixes mark reflexive forms
€gt-norm: Verb reflexives
jIlegh’egh 1Sg+legh+V+Refl I see myself
maleghchuq 1Pl+legh+V+Reciproc we see each other

Volition is a marker for volition:
€gt-norm: verb volition
€ leghnIS 3Sg+legh+V+Foc/nIs he sees nIS

Change is marked by suffixes
€gt-norm: Verbal  change
€ jIleghchoh 1Sg+legh+V+Foc/choh I see choh

Cause is marked
€gt-norm: Verbal cause
€ leghmoH 3Sg+legh+V+Caus cause him see

definiteness is just a suffix
€gt-norm: verbal definiteness
€ leghlu’ 3Sg+legh+V+Foc/lu’ he sees lu’

qualification the suffix

*verbal qualifications examples:*
* *leghchu’* `3Sg+legh+V+Foc/chu` (Eng. he sees chu’)

Aspects are coded in suffixes

*Verbal aspects examples:*
* *leghpu’* `3Sg+legh+V+Perf` (Eng. he finished seeing)

Verbs can have honorific markers

*Verbal honorifics examples:*
* *leghneS* `3Sg+legh+V+Honor` (Eng. he sees honorably)

And some other markers too

*Verb others examples:*
* *leghDI’* `3Sg+legh+V+Foc/DI’` (Eng. he sees DI’)
Verbs can always be derived into nouns with wI’:

*Deverbal nominals examples:*
* *leghwI’* `3Sg+legh+V+V→N+Sg+Nom` (Eng. his seeing)

# Morphology of tlhIngan HoI (Klingon)
This is an example morphology, for the purpose of demonstrating giellatekno
morphology infrastructure. The example language we use is a popular conlang
by the name of tlhIngan, popularly known by the English name Klingon. This
description uses latinised form, for yet-to-be encoded Klingon orthography,
a spelling variant rule is provided.

 # Definitions for Multichar_Symbols

## Analysis symbols
The morphological analyses of wordforms of Klingon language are presented
in this system in terms of following symbols.

The parts-of-speech are:
`Multichar_Symbols` for noun,
`Multichar_Symbols` for verb (and "adjectives"),
`Multichar_Symbols` for pronouns,
`Multichar_Symbols` for numerals,
`Multichar_Symbols` for conjunctions,
`Multichar_Symbols` for adverbs,
`Multichar_Symbols` for interjections, and
`Multichar_Symbols` for other, unclassified particles.

The nominals are inflected in following Numbers, cases and
augmentation:
`Multichar_Symbols` for singular,
`Multichar_Symbols` for plural,
`Multichar_Symbols` for locative,
`Multichar_Symbols` for instructive,
`Multichar_Symbols` for instrumental,
`Multichar_Symbols` for benefactive,
`Multichar_Symbols` for augmentative, and
`Multichar_Symbols` for diminitive

The possession is marked as such:
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (mine)
`Multichar_Symbols` for second singular (yours)
`Multichar_Symbols` for third singular (his/hers/its/theirs)
`Multichar_Symbols` for first plural (ours)
`Multichar_Symbols` for second plural (yours)
`Multichar_Symbols` for third plural (theirs)

Verb moods are:
`Multichar_Symbols` for indicative
`Multichar_Symbols` for imperative
Verb tenses or aspects are:
`Multichar_Symbols` for continuative
`Multichar_Symbols` for perfect tense
`Multichar_Symbols` for progressive

Verb personal forms in intransitives and unmarked objects are
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (I do [[myself, to someone])
`Multichar_Symbols` for second singular (you do [[yourself, to someone])
`Multichar_Symbols` for third singular (he/she/it/they do [[theirself, to someone])
`Multichar_Symbols` for first plural (we do [[ourself, to someone])
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (you do [[yourselves, to someone])
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (they do [[theirselves, to somone])

The verb personal forms objects are tagged separately:
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (– – does to me)
`Multichar_Symbols` for second singular (– – does to you])
`Multichar_Symbols` for third singular (– – does to them)
`Multichar_Symbols` for first plural (– – does to us)
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (– – does to you)
`Multichar_Symbols` for first singular (– – does to them)

Other verb forms are
`Multichar_Symbols` negated form
`Multichar_Symbols` reflexive form
`Multichar_Symbols` reciprocal form

`Multichar_Symbols`
 * +Symbol = independent symbols in the text stream, like £, €, ©
Special symbols are classified with:
`+Symbol`
`+Symbol`
`+Symbol`
`+Symbol` 
The verbs are syntactically split according to transitivity:
`+Symbol` transitive
`+Symbol` intransitive

Question and Focus particles:
`+Symbol` for question form
`+Symbol` other focus
`+Symbol` contrastive this focus
`+Symbol` contrastive that focus

Derivations are classified under the morphophonetic form of the suffix, the
source and target part-of-speech.


## Flag diacritics
We have manually optimised the structure of our lexicon using following
flag diacritics to restrict morhpological combinatorics - only allow compounds
with verbs if the verb is further derived into a noun again:
 |  @P.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 |  @D.NeedNoun.ON@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised
 |  @C.NeedNoun@ | (Dis)allow compounds with verbs unless nominalised

For languages that allow compounding, the following flag diacritics are needed
to control position-based compounding restrictions for nominals. Their use is
handled automatically if combined with +CmpN/xxx tags. If not used, they will
do no harm.
 |  @P.CmpFrst.FALSE@ | Require that words tagged as such only appear first
 |  @D.CmpPref.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering ENDLEX
 |  @P.CmpPref.FALSE@ | Block these words from making further compounds
 |  @D.CmpLast.TRUE@ | Block such words from entering R
 |  @D.CmpNone.TRUE@ | Combines with the next tag to prohibit compounding
 |  @U.CmpNone.FALSE@ | Combines with the prev tag to prohibit compounding
 |  @P.CmpOnly.TRUE@ | Sets a flag to indicate that the word has passed R
 |  @D.CmpOnly.FALSE@ | Disallow words coming directly from root.

Use the following flag diacritics to control downcasing of derived proper
nouns (e.g. Finnish Pariisi -> pariisilainen). See e.g. North Sámi for how to use
these flags. There exists a ready-made regex that will do the actual down-casing
given the proper use of these flags.
 |  @U.Cap.Obl@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.
 |  @U.Cap.Opt@ | Allowing downcasing of derived names: deatnulasj.

The word forms in Klingon language start from the lexeme roots of basic
word classes.
€gt-norm: Klingon poses
€ Sus Sus+N wind
€ jIJ jIH+Pron I
€ je je+Conj and
€ batlh batlh+Adv with honor
€ ghobe’ ghobe’+Intj no (as in discourse response)
The verbs require obligatory prefix that is the personal inflection or
imperative mood

*Klingon verb example examples:*
* *Qong* `3Sg+Qong+V` (Eng. sleeps)

Nouns
